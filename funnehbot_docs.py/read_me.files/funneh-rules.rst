Before using this Discord bot theree are rules that each user and server must follow.


**Updated on 12/3/21**


1. Do not spam commands. Spamming commands will result in rate-limits. That's why we have cooldowns.

2. Spam advertising with the /advertise command will get your server and the user blacklisted by the bot.

3. Leading people to bad servers with the /advertise command is not allowed.

4. Giving a spam/bad description of your server in the /advertise command is not allowed.

5. Using /webhookecho to swear, violate ToS, or say bad stuff about someone will lead to a harsh punishment.

6. Inviting Funneh Bot to a server with mass bots will not be tolerated as these stuff can be against Discord ToS.

After you invited read our ToS, please move to the file `funneh-slash.rst`.
