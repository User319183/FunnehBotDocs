Before using this Discord bot theree are rules that each user and server must follow.


-Updated on 12/10/21


1. Do not spam commands or buttons. Spamming commands will result in rate-limits. That's why we have cooldowns.

2. When using the command `/create_embed` follow the Discord ToS and the server owner's rules.

3. Misleading users to Discord servers with the `/advertise` command is not allowed.

4. Giving a spam/bad description of your server in the /advertise command is not allowed.

5. Using `/webhookecho` to swear, violate ToS, or say bad stuff about someone will lead to a harsh punishment.

6. Overusing the `/hack` command will lead to major API lag. Please try to not use this command in a short certain period of time
